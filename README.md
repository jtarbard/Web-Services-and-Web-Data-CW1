I. instructions on using the client (like a quick help page with a list of all commands
and how to use them).

    client is implemented as instructed, example commands below:

    list of commands: ["register", "login", "logout", "list", "view", "average", "rate"]
    Commands will provide information on their user if they are used incorrectly, including how many args are expected and in what order. If there are any unexpected results, check the order of the args passed.

II. the name of your pythonanywhere domain.
    sc18jt.pythonanywhere.com

III. the password I have to use to login to my admin account on your service.
    username: ammar
    password: password1234

IV. any other information I need in order to use your client
    The client uses tokens as recommended on the docs. The token is stored in a token.pkl file upon login. Url is also stored in a url.pkl file upon login or registration for persistence. This does not required any user interaction but if these files are deleted you will have to login again.
